 [score-card](https://github.com/Oriflame/backstage-plugins/blob/main/plugins/score-card/README.md) | Main idea behind it comes from a need to somehow visualize maturity of our services and to establish a process how to improve it (discuss with the teams what to focus on next).

## Thank you note

When creating this repository (pipelines, e2e tests, monorepo setup...) we were inspired a lot by a following repository [roadie-backstage-plugins](https://github.com/RoadieHQ/roadie-backstage-plugins).
